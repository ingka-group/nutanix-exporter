# _Nutanix Prism Prometheus Exporter_

## About

The Nutanix Exporter is a Go application that fetches live data from any number of Prism Element servers and presents it in a format ingestable by Prometheus. It runs as a docker container, automatically fetching all PE clusters from a Prism Central instance and exporting metrics from multiple APIv2 endpoints (VMs, Hosts, Clusters, etc.).

## Features

- YAML config files define which metrics to collect
- Hashicorp Vault support for fetching cluster credentials
- Refreshes credentials from Vault on 4xx errors
- Parent Exporter class that can be extended for any APIv2 endpoint
- Per cluster metrics exposed at `/metrics/cluster-name`
- Optional filtering by cluster name prefix

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Hashicorp Vault server with KVv2 Secrets Engine enabled
  - Secrets Engine name: defined in `VAULT_ENGINE_NAME` environment variable
  - Secret name: defined in `PE_TASK_ACCOUNT` and `PC_TASK_ACCOUNT` environment variables
  - Fields: username, secret
- Nutanix Prism Central 2023.4 or later

### Metrics Configuration

`/config` contains a YAML configuration file for each exporter. This is where the metrics to be collected are defined. Any value in the API response can be collected; the exporter will walk the JSON response and collect values matching the metric keys defined in the configuration file.

Each entry must have the following fields:

- name: The name of the metric key in the API response
- help: User defined description of the metric

```yaml
- name: memory_mb
  help: Memory in MB.
- name: power_state
  help: Power state of the VM.
- name: vcpu_reservation_hz
  help: vCPU reservation in Hz.
```

Default configuration files are provided for each APIv2 endpoint. These can be overwritten when running the exporter by mounting a new configuration file into the container as seen in the deployment section.

## Running the Exporter

While the exporter is designed to run in a containerized environment, it can also be run natively on a host. The following instructions will guide you through both methods. For production environments, the exporter should always be run in a container. However, for development and testing, running the exporter natively is generally easier.

For both methods, start by cloning the repository and navigating to the repo root in your terminal.

To build and run the Go binary natively:

1. Download and install Go from [here](https://go.dev/doc/install)
2. Export all necessary environment variables
3. `go run cmd/nutanix_exporter/main.go`
4. The exporter will now be running on `localhost:9408`

To build and run in a container:

1. Download and install Docker from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. `docker build -t nutanix_exporter .`
3. `docker run -p 9408:9408 --env-file configs/exporter.env nutanix_exporter`
4. The exporter will now be running on `localhost:9408`

Example exporter.env:

```yaml
VAULT_ADDR=https://your-vault-server.yourdomain.com
VAULT_NAMESPACE=production
VAULT_ENGINE_NAME=NutanixKV2
VAULT_ROLE_ID=12345678-1234-5678-1234-567812345678
VAULT_SECRET_ID=12345678-1234-5678-1234-567812345678
PC_CLUSTER_NAME=your-pc-cluster-name
PC_CLUSTER_URL=https://your-pc-cluster.yourdomain.com:9440
PE_TASK_ACCOUNT=PETaskAccount
PC_TASK_ACCOUNT=PCTaskAccount
CLUSTER_PREFIX=optional-cluster-prefix to filter cluster names
```

## Deployment

Example docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
services:
  NutanixExporter:
    image: "distributedhostingcodecommunity-docker-dev-local/nutanix/nutanix_exporter:latest"
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /path/to/your/configs/cluster.yaml:configs/cluster.yaml:z
      - /path/to/your/configs/storagecontainer.yaml:configs/storagecontainer.yaml:z
      - /path/to/your/configs/host.yaml:configs/host.yaml:z
      - /path/to/your/configs/vm.yaml:configs/vm.yaml:z
    env_file:
      - /path/to/your/configs/exporter.env
    ports:
      - '9408:9408'

```
